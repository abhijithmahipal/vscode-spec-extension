# Enhanced Error Handling and User Guidance

This document describes the comprehensive error handling and user guidance improvements implemented for the VSCode Spec-Driven Development extension.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Comprehensive Error Handling System (`errorHandler.ts`)

#### Error Classification

- **File System Errors**: File not found, permission denied, write failures
- **Workspace Errors**: No workspace, invalid workspace, read-only workspace
- **Spec Workflow Errors**: Invalid phase transitions, validation failures, spec conflicts
- **Task Execution Errors**: Task not found, dependencies not met, already completed
- **External Errors**: Clipboard failures, network errors, external command failures

#### Recovery Actions

Each error provides contextual recovery actions:

- **Primary Actions**: Most likely solutions (marked with `primary: true`)
- **Secondary Actions**: Alternative approaches
- **Fallback Actions**: Last resort options

#### Error Examples

```typescript
// File not found error with recovery actions
const error = ErrorHandler.createFileNotFoundError("/path/to/missing/file");
// Provides: Create File, Choose Different File, Refresh Workspace

// Validation error with suggestions
const error = ErrorHandler.createValidationError(
  "Requirements missing user stories",
  ["Add user stories", "Use EARS format", "Review examples"]
);

// Workspace error with setup actions
const error = ErrorHandler.createWorkspaceError("No workspace folder");
// Provides: Open Folder, Create New Folder
```

### 2. User Guidance System (`userGuidance.ts`)

#### Contextual Guidance

Provides phase-specific guidance based on current state:

- **Requirements Phase**: Focus on user stories and EARS format
- **Design Phase**: Architecture and component design
- **Tasks Phase**: Breaking down work into manageable tasks
- **Execution Phase**: Implementation best practices

#### Guidance Categories

- **Next Steps**: High-priority actions to move forward
- **Suggestions**: Helpful improvements and best practices
- **Warnings**: Issues that need attention
- **Tips**: Educational content and best practices

#### Progress Encouragement

Dynamic messages based on completion percentage:

- 0%: "üöÄ Ready to start implementation!"
- 25%: "üå± Great start! You're building momentum."
- 50%: "üí™ You're making solid progress!"
- 75%: "üî• More than halfway there!"
- 100%: "üéâ Congratulations! You've completed all tasks."

### 3. Validation System (`validationSystem.ts`)

#### Comprehensive Validation Rules

**Requirements Phase:**

- File existence validation
- User story format checking
- EARS acceptance criteria validation
- Content sufficiency analysis

**Design Phase:**

- Architecture section validation
- Requirements coverage checking
- Component design validation

**Tasks Phase:**

- Checkbox format validation
- Requirement reference checking
- Task size appropriateness
- Dependency validation

**Execution Phase:**

- Task availability validation
- Progress tracking
- Completion status monitoring

#### Validation Results

- **Passed**: All validations successful
- **Warning**: Issues that should be addressed but don't block progress
- **Failed**: Critical issues that must be resolved

### 4. Integration with Existing Components

#### SpecWorkflowManager Updates

- Enhanced error handling in all operations
- Contextual validation using the new validation system
- User guidance integration for better feedback
- Progress encouragement messages

#### Extension.ts Updates

- Consistent error handling across all commands
- Recovery-focused error dialogs
- Contextual guidance command (`specMode.showGuidance`)
- Periodic tip display

#### SpecPanelProvider Updates

- Guidance button in the UI
- Better error feedback in tree views
- Contextual help integration

## User Experience Improvements

### 1. Error Recovery Flow

1. **Error Occurs**: System catches and classifies the error
2. **User Notification**: Clear, non-technical error message
3. **Recovery Options**: Contextual actions to resolve the issue
4. **Guided Resolution**: Step-by-step recovery process
5. **Success Feedback**: Confirmation when issue is resolved

### 2. Contextual Guidance Flow

1. **State Analysis**: System analyzes current phase and progress
2. **Guidance Generation**: Creates personalized next steps and tips
3. **User Presentation**: Shows guidance through dialogs or panels
4. **Action Integration**: Provides direct actions to implement suggestions
5. **Progress Tracking**: Updates guidance based on user actions

### 3. Validation Feedback Flow

1. **Continuous Validation**: Runs validation checks during phase transitions
2. **Issue Identification**: Categorizes validation failures by severity
3. **User Notification**: Shows validation results with fix suggestions
4. **Quick Fixes**: Provides one-click solutions where possible
5. **Progress Monitoring**: Tracks resolution of validation issues

## Commands Added

### `specMode.showGuidance`

- **Title**: üí° Get Guidance
- **Function**: Shows contextual help and next steps
- **Availability**: Always available in spec panel
- **Integration**: Accessible via command palette and UI button

## Error Handling Examples

### File System Error

```
‚ùå Required file "requirements.md" was not found

Recovery Options:
‚Ä¢ Create Missing File (Recommended)
‚Ä¢ Choose Different File
‚Ä¢ Refresh Workspace
‚Ä¢ View Details
```

### Validation Error

```
‚ö†Ô∏è Validation failed: Requirements missing user stories

Suggestions:
‚Ä¢ Add user stories in format: 'As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]'
‚Ä¢ Consider different user types and their needs
‚Ä¢ Focus on the 'why' behind each feature

Quick Fix: Create Requirements File
```

### Workspace Error

```
‚ùå No workspace folder is open

Recovery Options:
‚Ä¢ Open Folder (Recommended)
‚Ä¢ Create New Folder
‚Ä¢ View Details
```

## User Guidance Examples

### Requirements Phase Guidance

```
üí° Next: Create Requirements Document

Ready to begin requirements phase! Start by copying the requirements prompt and working with Copilot.

Tips:
‚Ä¢ Start with user stories: 'As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]'
‚Ä¢ Use EARS format for acceptance criteria
‚Ä¢ Consider edge cases and error scenarios early
```

### Progress Encouragement

```
üî• More than halfway there! You're doing great.

Progress: 4/6 tasks completed (67%)

Next: Continue Implementation
Focus on completing each task fully before moving to the next.
```
