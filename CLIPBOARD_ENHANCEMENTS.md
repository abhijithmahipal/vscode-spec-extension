- ✅ Provides success notification after successful copy
- ✅ Offers next steps (Open Copilot Chat, Dismiss)

### 2. Multiple Prompt Selection (Requirement 8.2)

**WHEN multiple prompts are available THEN the system SHALL allow users to choose which prompt to copy**

- ✅ `copyFromMultiplePrompts()` method handles multiple prompt options
- ✅ Quick pick interface shows all available prompts with descriptions
- ✅ Phase-specific prompts are automatically generated
- ✅ Task execution prompts are available for incomplete tasks

### 3. Fallback Options (Requirement 8.3)

**WHEN clipboard operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide alternative methods to access prompts**

- ✅ Automatic fallback to file saving when clipboard fails
- ✅ Preview option to view content in editor
- ✅ Retry mechanism for transient clipboard failures
- ✅ User-friendly error messages with recovery options

### 4. Enhanced Context and Instructions (Requirement 8.4)

**WHEN prompts are generated THEN the system SHALL include all necessary context and instructions**

- ✅ Prompts include timestamp and generation metadata
- ✅ Context files are listed for reference
- ✅ Enhanced formatting with clear sections
- ✅ Extension attribution for generated prompts

### 5. Long Prompt Handling (Requirement 8.5)

**WHEN working with long prompts THEN the system SHALL provide options to view and edit before copying**

- ✅ Special handling for prompts over 1000 characters
- ✅ "View & Edit" option opens prompt in editor
- ✅ Warning about potential truncation
- ✅ Options to copy anyway or save to file

## Usage

### Basic Clipboard Operations

```typescript
// Copy a single prompt with enhancements
await ClipboardManager.copyPromptWithEnhancements(
  promptContent,
  "Prompt Title",
  ["context-file1.md", "context-file2.md"]
);
```

### Multiple Prompt Selection

```typescript
// Create prompt options
const prompts = [
  ClipboardManager.createPromptOption(
    "req",
    "Requirements",
    content1,
    "Generate requirements",
    ["req.md"]
  ),
  ClipboardManager.createPromptOption(
    "design",
    "Design",
    content2,
    "Create design",
    ["design.md"]
  ),
];

// Let user choose
await ClipboardManager.copyFromMultiplePrompts(prompts);
```

### Integration with Workflow Manager

```typescript
// Get all available prompts for current phase
const prompts = await workflowManager.getAvailablePrompts();
await ClipboardManager.copyFromMultiplePrompts(prompts);
```

## User Interface

### New Command: "Copy Prompts"

- Available in Spec Panel toolbar when spec is active
- Command ID: `specMode.copyPrompts`
- Icon: Clipboard (clippy)
- Shows quick pick with all available prompts for current phase

### Enhanced Notifications

- **Success**: "✅ [Title] copied to clipboard successfully!"
- **Preview**: Shows truncated content with "..." indicator
- **Failure**: Clear error message with fallback options
- **Long Prompts**: Warning about length with viewing options

### Fallback Methods

1. **Save to File**: Creates `.md` file in workspace root
2. **Preview**: Opens content in new editor tab
3. **View & Edit**: Opens for editing with copy options
4. **Retry**: Attempts clipboard operation again

## Error Handling

### Clipboard Failures

- Network/permission issues
- System clipboard unavailable
- Memory limitations

### Recovery Options

- Automatic fallback to file saving
- Manual retry mechanism
- Preview in editor as alternative
- User-friendly error messages

## File Structure

```
src/
├── clipboardManager.ts          # Main clipboard functionality
├── specWorkflowManager.ts       # Enhanced with clipboard integration
├── extension.ts                 # Updated commands and integration
├── specPanelProvider.ts         # UI updates for clipboard access
└── test/
    └── clipboardManager.test.ts # Unit tests
```

## Testing

### Unit Tests

- Prompt option creation
- Context enhancement
- Preview generation

### Integration Tests

- Full clipboard workflow
- Fallback mechanisms
- UI integration

### Manual Testing Scenarios

1. **Normal Operation**: Copy prompt → Verify clipboard → Success notification
2. **Long Prompts**: Generate long prompt → View options → Edit/Copy
3. **Multiple Prompts**: Access copy prompts → Select from list → Copy
4. **Clipboard Failure**: Simulate failure → Verify fallback options
5. **Context Enhancement**: Verify prompts include context files and metadata

## Configuration

No additional configuration required. The enhanced clipboard functionality is automatically available when the extension is active.

## Backward Compatibility

All existing clipboard operations continue to work. The enhancements are additive and don't break existing functionality.

## Performance Considerations

- Prompt preview generation is optimized for quick display
- Long prompts are handled efficiently with streaming
- Context file references don't load actual file content
- Fallback operations are lightweight

## Future Enhancements

Potential future improvements:

- Prompt templates and customization
- Clipboard history
- Prompt sharing between team members
- Integration with external prompt libraries
